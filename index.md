		**Narrative**
		<div align="center">
	The artifact I chose was a personal project that I had done for my use only. The idea behind it came from playing a game called World of Warcraft. When you make a character, you must choose several options including what class you want to play. I always have trouble deciding so I made a random generator that would choose a class for me. I made it in Python, and it had many flaws, including not having any form of a GUI. Since I created it early in my learning process for classes, I really had no idea what I was doing, and it left the code very bloated with a lot of unnecessary steps.
	I have included this project because I know I can do better. I learned how to make a reasonable GUI in Java and so I decided to port the code over to Java and simplify it as much as possible to prepare it for the next steps of adding more options and features to it. Right now, the biggest improvement that has been made is to use a GUI and to make it so that the user can reroll the choice as many times as they want. This new program shows off my skills with Java. I feel like that is important since I prefer to use and write in Java more than any other language. It also helped me learn more about my weakest areas in Java, using and creating a GUI.
	I feel like I met the course objectives because I took an old program written in Python and was able to rewrite it in Java, while at the same time enhancing what the program could do. I had originally planned many more changes, but time did not allow me to get those finished quite yet. I have learned a lot about best practices and keeping a program simple to help with future updates and coding.
